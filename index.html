          Install a local test server on your computer. The test server will
          handle requests and send web pages to your browser, just like a real
          web server. The only difference is that the test server won't accept
          remote connections from other computers.

          There are many choices for a test server. However, two simple,
          reliable choices are the http-server and lite-server packages that you
          can install through npm.We use lite-server here, because it adds a
          live update feature that automatically refreshes the page in the
          browser when you save changed code in your editor.

          if you want to update a dependency to use a new major version, you
          need to do it deliberately. Options include editing the package-json
          file by hand or using a tool that con do it for you.The npm check
          updates tool allows you to review your dependencies, see what updates
          are available, and choose the package-json file to allow a major
          version update.

          Tool choices aren't static. As a developer, your preferences may
          shift. You will grow your kit as you evolve and as new tools prove
          themselves useful. This chapter explores the minimum toolset that
          every javascript developer should consider before they tackle a
          project.
